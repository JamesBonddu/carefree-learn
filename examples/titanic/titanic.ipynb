    "\n",
    "Since `Titanic` is just a small toy datasets, using Neural Network to solve it might actually 'over-killed' (or, overfit) it, and that's why we decided to conclude here instead of introducing more fancy techniques (e.g. ensemble, AutoML, etc.). We hope that this small example can help you quickly walk through some basic concepts in `carefre-learn`, as well as help you leverage `carefree-learn` in your own tasks!"
